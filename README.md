🔐 AIPG Paper Wallet Instructions 🔐

A paper wallet is a physical document containing your private and public keys, typically printed in the form of QR codes. It is considered one of the most secure ways to hold AIPG because it keeps your keys completely offline and safe from online hacking attempts. 

Follow these steps to create your AIPG paper wallet:

1. Download the `aipg-paper-wallet.html` file from the official AIPG repository.
Link: https://github.com/AIPowerGrid/aipg-paper-wallet

2. For extra security, ensure you are offline before generating your wallet. Disconnect your computer from the internet to protect against any online threats.

3. Run the `aipg-paper-wallet.html` file locally on your computer.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to generate your new paper wallet.

5. Once your wallet has been created, print it out immediately.

6. Verify that the printed document contains your public and private keys in QR code format.

7. Store the printed paper wallet in a safe and secure location, like a safe or a safety deposit box. Treat it as you would cash or other valuables.

⚠️ Remember, if you lose your paper wallet or if it gets damaged to the point that the keys are not legible, you will lose access to your AIPG. There is no way to recover your funds without your keys, so keep them secure and consider making backups.

For additional security, it is recommended to laminate your paper wallet to protect against physical damage and use a secure container for storage.

Your AIPG paper wallet is now ready to receive funds! To send or check your balance, you will use the public key (visible on the paper wallet). Always keep your private key confidential, as anyone with access to it can control your AIPG funds.

The AI Power GRID - AIPG project (aipowergrid.io) provides an all-in-one HTML document with embedded
JavaScript/Css/Images. The JavaScript is readable not minified and contains no
XMLHttpRequest's (no AJAX). The benefit of this technique is you can load the 
JavaScript locally and trust that the JavaScript did not change after being 
loaded.

**Procedure for Importing a Paper Wallet into the QT Wallet:**

1) Perform a clean installation on a system without any previous wallet (ensure the absence of the .aipg directory). Prior to deletion, safeguard your seed words.

2) Run ./aipgd in one terminal window.

3) In another terminal window, execute ./aipg-cli importprivkey "MY-PRIVATE-KEY-GENERATED-ON-PAPER-WALLET".

4) Close the ./aipgd window (CTRL-C).

5) Open the QT wallet, set a passphrase, allow it to synchronize for a few minutes, and start enjoying your wallet.

END USER NOTES:

 1) For Bulk Wallet I recommended using Google Chrome, it's the fastest.

 2) Requires IE9+, Firefox, Chrome or sufficient JavaScript support.

 3) Mobile Safari only works with iPhone4 or newer devices.
    Older devices timeout while executing JavaScript.

 4) DO NOT use Opera Mini it renders JavaScript output server side, therefore
    they might record the private key you generated.

 5) BIP38 most likely will not work on mobile devices due to hardware limitations.
